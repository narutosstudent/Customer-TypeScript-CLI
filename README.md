# Customer-TypeScript-CLI

TypeScript CLI tool that lets non technical people analyze customer data.

## TODO

- [x] Create a new project
- [x] Display menu with options
- [x] List customer names and emails
- [x] Display customer details -> Input customer ID -> Show details
- [x] Total amount spent by each customer -> Input customer ID -> Show total amount
- [x] Most recent purchase for each customer -> Input customer ID -> Show most recent purchase

## Run it

Clone it.

`npm install`.

`npm run execute` to run the CLI tool.

## Background information

I wanted to build a CLI tool to see how it is. Never done one as a side project.

## Experience

`inqurier` is a great library to build CLI tools. It has a lot of options and it's easy to use. I enjoyed it a ton.

Curious to see how it works under the hood, might be my next side project, trying to rebuild it lmfao

## Testing

No testing included.

But if I was to write tests for this, direction to take:

- Unit test the functions
- Integration test the CLI tool

Integration testing the CLI tool is much easier than I thought lol, they got a package for it: https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/tree/master/packages/testing
